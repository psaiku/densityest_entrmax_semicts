Paper https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S1051200421001469 describes an algo to estimate the density function for semi-continuous data using entropy maximization. This repo has R codes that produce the numerical results in the paper. 

File semicts_est_utils.R - has functions that are used by tpexp-sim.R and tpgamma-sim.R
